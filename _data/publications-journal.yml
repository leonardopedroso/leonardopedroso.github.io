  abstract: "This article addresses the problem of designing a decentralized control solution for a network of agents modeled by linear time-varying (LTV) dynamics, in a discrete-time framework. A general scheme is proposed, in which the problem is formulated as a classical linear quadratic regulator problem, for the global system, subject to a given sparsity constraint on the gain, which reflects the decentralized nature of the network. A method able to compute a sequence of well-performing stabilizing regulator gains is presented and validated resorting to simulations of two randomly generated LTV systems, one stable and the other unstable. Moreover, a tracking solution is developed, building on the solution to the regulator problem. Both methods rely on a closed-form solution, thus they can be computed very rapidly. Similarly to the centralized solution, both the presented methods require that a window of the future system dynamics is known. Both methods are validated resorting to simulations of: (i) a nonlinear network of four interconnected tanks; and (ii) a large-scale nonlinear network of interconnected tanks. When implemented to a nonlinear network, approximated by an LTV system, the proposed methods are able to compute well-performing gains that track the desired output. Finally, both algorithms are scalable, being adequate for implementation in large-scale networks."

  abstract: "The major hurdle in accessing laboratory experimentation is the cost of acquiring experimental scientific equipment, which is unbearable for many institutions. This paper aims to provide the community of control educators, practitioners, and researchers with an open-source low-cost experimental setup and dedicated interface, which is flexible and very easily reproducible. The proposed apparatus is a setup of four interconnected tanks. The setup is representative of real-life industrial processes and it can be adjusted to allow for several configurations for flexibility. A user-friendly dedicated MATLAB/Simulink interface with a personal computer is developed. It supports a seamless shift between a numeric simulation of the quadruple-tank process dynamics and the interface with the physical experimental plant. The CAD models, technical drawings, wiring schematics, PCB design, interface, assembly tutorials, and several examples are provided in an open-source repository. The parts are inexpensive, readily obtained, and fast to assemble. Each setup costs under 650€ and takes roughly 4 h to assemble. In this paper, several application examples are presented, not only for educational purposes, but also for the validation of a state-of-the-art decentralized control method."

  abstract: "This paper aims to explore a new technique for structural damage identification using cubic spline interpolation. The method is based on the interpolation of modal rotations measured with shearography, making use of the analytical derivative of the spline to compute the modal curvature, which is known to be very sensitive to damage. As a means of reducing noise and measurement uncertainty propagation to a minimum, an expression for an optimal spatial sampling is derived. Furthermore, a baseline-free damage factor, allied with an optimal sampling, is also introduced. The proposed identification method is validated using experimental data of a beam. Using a damage localisation quality index, a comparison between the present method and one using finite differences is carried out, showing that the differentiation of spline interpolation leads to better damage identifications. The results obtained with the proposed approach show robustness and consistency in the localisations. Additionally, the hurdles of identifying small and multiple damage are tackled with the proposed method, yielding a good performance."

  abstract: "Signal control strategies for congested urban road networks designed in a centralized framework require many communication links, serious processing power, and infrastructure for the centralized coordination. As a result, strategies based on a centralized framework are not scalable. The use of decentralized signal control strategies for large-scale urban traffic networks is a solution to this problem, since it allows for the implementation of such strategies on networks whose centralized solution is not easily scalable. This paper addresses the problem of designing a decentralized traffic-responsive signal control solution, proposing two methods based on different formulations of the store-and-forward model: (i) the Decentralized Traffic-responsive Urban Control (DTUC) method; and (ii) the Decentralized Decoupled Traffic-responsive Urban Control (D2TUC). The decentralized configuration is such that each intersection is associated with one computational unit, with limited computational power and memory, which controls the traffic signals of the incoming links. Sufficient conditions for the controllability of the considered store-and-forward models are also presented. Both methods are validated resorting to numerical simulations of the urban traffic network of Chania, Greece, for two demand scenarios, and their performance is compared with the performance of the Traffic-responsive Urban Control (TUC) centralized strategy. One of the proposed decentralized methods, D2TUC, is shown to match the performance of TUC."

  abstract: "In this short communication, an algorithm for efficiently solving a sparse matrix equation, which arises frequently in the field of distributed control and estimation theory, is proposed. The efficient algorithm stems from the fact that the sparse equation at hand can be reduced to a system of linear equations. The proposed algorithm is shown to require significantly fewer floating point operations than the state-of-the-art solution. The proposed solution is applied to a real-life example, which models a wide range of industrial processes. The experimental results show that the solution put forward allows for a significant increase in efficiency in relation to the state-of-the-art solution. The significant increase in efficiency of the presented algorithm allows for a valuable widening of the applications of distributed estimation and control."
