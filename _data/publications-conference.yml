  abstract: "The SAFFRON toolbox is introduced to synthesize, analyze, and simulate store-and-forward based strategies for the signal control problem in congested urban road networks in MATLAB. It features: i) well-documented tools to manipulate and simulate store-and-forward macroscopic traffic network models; ii) the parameters of the model of the urban road network of the city center of Chania, Greece; and iii) the implementation of state-of-the-art signal control strategies."

  abstract: "This paper aims to explore a new technique for structural damage identification using cubic spline interpolation. The method is based on the interpolation of modal rotations measured with speckle shearography. In order to locate the damaged areas, we make use of the analytical derivative of the cubic spline function to compute the modal curvature, which is known to be very sensitive to damage. A comprehensive parametric study of the spatial sampling interval is carried out to find its influence on noise filtering. Furthermore, the identification quality dependency on the mode shape and respective noise is also examined. The results obtained with the proposed method show the consistency of the localizations. Additionally, the challenging tasks of identifying small and multiple damage are tackled, yielding a good performance."
