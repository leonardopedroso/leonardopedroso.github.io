  about-me      : I received the BSc in Aerospace Engineering in 2020, from Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (IST), University of Lisbon (Ulisboa), Portugal, and I will receive the MSc in 2022. I received four academic excellence diplomas, endowed by IST, and four outstanding academic performance awards, endowed by ULisboa. I was also awarded an honorable mention in the 48th International Physics Olympiad. Since 2019 I am a member of the research team of the DECENTER project, funded by the Portuguese National Science Foundation. My current research interest is <b>decentralized control</b> and <b>estimation</b>  over <b>very large-scale</b> networks.
