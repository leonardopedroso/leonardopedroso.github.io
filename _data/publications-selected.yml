  abstract: "The transition from large centralized complex control systems to distributed configurations that rely on a network of a very large number of interconnected simpler subsystems is ongoing and inevitable in many applications. It is attributed to the quest for resilience, flexibility, and scalability in a multitude of engineering fields with far-reaching societal impact. Although many design methods for distributed and decentralized control systems are available, most of them rely on a centralized design procedure requiring some form of global information of the whole system. Clearly, beyond a certain scale of the network, these centralized design procedures for distributed controllers are no longer feasible and we refer to the corresponding systems as ultra large-scale systems (ULSS). For these ULSS, design algorithms are needed that are distributed themselves among the subsystems and are subject to stringent requirements regarding communication, computation, and memory usage of each subsystem. In this paper, a set of requirements is provided that assures a feasible real-time implementation of all phases of a control solution on an ultra large scale. State-of-the-art approaches are reviewed in the light of these requirements and the challenges hampering the development of befitting control algorithms are pinpointed. Comparing the challenges with the current progress leads to the identification and motivation of promising research directions."

  abstract: "We study a dynamic game with a large population of players who choose actions from a finite set in continuous time. Each player has a state in a finite state space that evolves stochastically with their actions. A player's reward depends not only on their own state and action but also on the distribution of states and actions across the population, capturing effects such as congestion in traffic networks. While prior work in evolutionary game theory has primarily focused on static games without individual player state dynamics, we present the first comprehensive evolutionary analysis of such dynamic games. We propose an evolutionary model together with a mean field approximation of the finite-population game and establish strong approximation guarantees. We show that standard solution concepts for dynamic games lack an evolutionary interpretation, and we propose a new concept - the Mixed Stationary Nash Equilibrium (MSNE) - which admits one. We analyze the relationship between MSNE and the rest points of the mean field evolutionary model and study the evolutionary stability of MSNE."

#  abstract: "When users access shared resources in a selfish manner, the resulting societal cost and perceived users' cost is often higher than what would result from a centrally coordinated optimal allocation. While several contributions in mechanism design manage to steer the aggregate users choices to the desired optimum by using monetary tolls, such approaches bear the inherent drawback of discriminating against users with a lower income. More recently, incentive schemes based on artificial currencies have been studied with the goal of achieving a system-optimal resource allocation that is also fair. In this resource-sharing context, this paper focuses on repeated weighted congestion game with two resources, where users contribute to the congestion to different extents that are captured by individual weights. First, we address the broad concept of fairness by providing a rigorous mathematical characterization of the distinct societal metrics of equity and equality, i.e., the concepts of providing equal outcomes and equal opportunities, respectively. Second, we devise weight-dependent and time-invariant optimal pricing policies to maximize equity and equality, and prove convergence of the aggregate user choices to the system-optimum. In our framework it is always possible to achieve system-optimal allocations with perfect equity, while the maximum equality that can be reached may not be perfect, which is also shown via numerical simulations."

  abstract: "The design of a decentralized and distributed filtering solution for large-scale networks of interconnected systems is addressed considering (i) generic nonlinear dynamics and (ii) generic coupled nonlinear outputs in a generic, possibly time-varying, topology. The local filters, which follow the structure of the extended Kalman filter, are implemented in each system, which estimates its own state exclusively. To be suitable for the heavily restricted implementation to very large-scale systems, a novel algorithm is proposed, which: (i) does not rely on instantaneous data transmission; (ii) allows local communication exclusively; and (iii) requires computational, memory, and data transmission resources for each system that do not scale with the dimension of the network. The scalability of the proposed algorithm allows for its application to the cooperative localization problem of very large-scale systems. In particular, it is applied herein to the on-board position estimation problem of LEO mega-constellations using GNSS featuring numerical simulations for the Starlink constellation."

#  abstract: "The major hurdle in accessing laboratory experimentation is the cost of acquiring experimental scientific equipment, which is unbearable for many institutions. This paper aims to provide the community of control educators, practitioners, and researchers with an open-source low-cost experimental setup and dedicated interface, which is flexible and very easily reproducible. The proposed apparatus is a setup of four interconnected tanks. The setup is representative of real-life industrial processes and it can be adjusted to allow for several configurations for flexibility. A user-friendly dedicated MATLAB/Simulink interface with a personal computer is developed. It supports a seamless shift between a numeric simulation of the quadruple-tank process dynamics and the interface with the physical experimental plant. The CAD models, technical drawings, wiring schematics, PCB design, interface, assembly tutorials, and several examples are provided in an open-source repository. The parts are inexpensive, readily obtained, and fast to assemble. Each setup costs under 650€ and takes roughly 4 h to assemble. In this paper, several application examples are presented, not only for educational purposes, but also for the validation of a state-of-the-art decentralized control method."

#- title: Decentralized store-and-forward based strategies for the signal control problem in large-scale congested urban road networks

#  abstract: "Signal control strategies for congested urban road networks designed in a centralized framework require many communication links, serious processing power, and infrastructure for the centralized coordination. As a result, strategies based on a centralized framework are not scalable. The use of decentralized signal control strategies for large-scale urban traffic networks is a solution to this problem, since it allows for the implementation of such strategies on networks whose centralized solution is not easily scalable. This paper addresses the problem of designing a decentralized traffic-responsive signal control solution, proposing two methods based on different formulations of the store-and-forward model: (i) the Decentralized Traffic-responsive Urban Control (DTUC) method; and (ii) the Decentralized Decoupled Traffic-responsive Urban Control (D2TUC). The decentralized configuration is such that each intersection is associated with one computational unit, with limited computational power and memory, which controls the traffic signals of the incoming links. Sufficient conditions for the controllability of the considered store-and-forward models are also presented. Both methods are validated resorting to numerical simulations of the urban traffic network of Chania, Greece, for two demand scenarios, and their performance is compared with the performance of the Traffic-responsive Urban Control (TUC) centralized strategy. One of the proposed decentralized methods, D2TUC, is shown to match the performance of TUC."

#  abstract: "This paper addresses the problem of designing a decentralized state estimation solution for a large-scale network of interconnected unconstrained linear time invariant (LTI) systems. The problem is tackled in a novel moving horizon estimation (MHE) framework, while taking into account the limited communication capabilities and the restricted computational power and memory, which are distributed across the network. The proposed design is motivated by the fact that, in a decentralized setting, a Luenberguer-based framework is unable to leverage the full potential of the available local information. A method is derived to solve a relaxed version of the resulting optimization problem. It can be synthesized offline and its stability can be assessed prior to deployment. It is shown that the proposed approach allows for significant improvement on the performance of recent Luenberger-based filters. Furthermore, we show that a state-of-the-art distributed MHE solution with comparable requirements underperforms in comparison to the proposed solution."
